# Pet project: Cross-platform chat application with .NET MAUI and ASP.NET Web API

## Roadmap: https://trello.com/b/6a9B656l/crossplatformchatpublic

## Description:
This Github repository contains the source code for a cross-platform chat application built using .NET MAUI framework and ASP.NET Web API. The application features a client-server architecture where clients can communicate with the server and perform various CRUD operations using SQLite on the client-side and MySQL on the server-side.

The client-side of the application is built using .NET MAUI, which is a cross-platform UI framework for building native mobile and desktop applications. The client-side database is implemented using SQLite, which provides a lightweight and efficient way to store data on the client-side. The application allows users to send messages, view conversations, and perform various CRUD operations on their conversations.

The server-side of the application is built using ASP.NET Web API, which provides a framework for building RESTful services. The server-side database is implemented using MySQL and Entity Framework, which provides an efficient way to store and retrieve data on the server-side. The application allows users to send messages to other users, view their conversations, authentacate and perform various CRUD operations on their conversations.
